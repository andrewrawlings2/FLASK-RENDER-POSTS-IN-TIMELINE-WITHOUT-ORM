# FLASK-RENDER-POSTS-IN-TIMELINE-WITHOUT-ORM

This is how I used MySQL to create a twitter clone and render posts based on username and timestamp in a timeline format without an ORM like SQLAlchemy.
I prefered working without an ORM because it allows more creativity and understanding of the implicit processes being run.
